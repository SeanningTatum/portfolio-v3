# Feature: <Name>

_Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD_

## Purpose
One paragraph. What this feature does and why it exists.

## When It's Used
- User trigger / entry point
- Lifecycle event (load, mount, relaunch)
- Cross-feature interaction

## How It Works
Narrative description of the runtime flow: which service / repo / route owns state, what calls what, where persistence happens, where errors map.

### Persistence details
- Storage location (D1 table, R2 prefix, KV namespace, file path)
- Schema / envelope shape
- Write semantics (debounce, sync, batch)
- Migration / corruption behavior

### Testability
What is unit-tested. Stub layers used. Edge cases covered. Link the feature-verifier doc: `.brain/features/<slug>/verifications/<date>.md` (browser walk + screenshots). Note any `e2e/` smoke spec if this path is CI-guarded.
